# Terra Draw Route Snapping Mode

Please see the main Terra Draw repository for more details: [https://www.github.com/JamesLMilner/terra-draw](https://www.github.com/JamesLMilner/terra-draw)

This is currently a work in progress demo a route snapping mode. It is designed to be somewhat agnostic to the routing algorithm used (although there is some debate about if maybe it should use some sort of node ids rather than [number, number] latitude longitudes for route generation input).

If this is successful I will look at publishing it as a standalone mode.
